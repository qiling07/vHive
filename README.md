## News

A full-day tutorial, co-located with the ASPLOS'22 conference, is going to take place in Lausanne, Switzerland on March 1. The tutorial will be in a hybrid format (both in-person and virtual) and will cover both the serverless cloud foundations and the vHive ecosystem and include several hands-on sessions. In this tutorial, the participants will learn how to analyze performance of commercial and open-source clouds as well as how to experiment and innovate across serverless stack using vHive. For more information, please visit the [tutorial webpage](https://ease-lab.github.io/vhive-asplos22).

## Mission

vHive aims to enable serverless systems researchers to innovate across the deep and distributed software stacks
of a modern serverless platform. Hence, we built vHive to be representative of the leading
Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) providers, integrating the same production-grade components used by the providers, including
[AWS Firecracker hypervisor](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/),
Cloud Native Computing Foundation's [Containerd](https://containerd.io/),
and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). 

vHive adopts the [Knative](https://knative.dev/) flexible programming model, allowing the researchers to quickly deploy
and experiment with *any* serverless applications that may comprise many functions,
running in secure Firecracker microVMs, as well as serverfull services.
Both the functions and the stateful services can be deployed using OCI/Docker images.

vHive empowers systems researchers to innovate on key serverless features,
including functions autoscaling and cold-start delay optimization with several snapshotting mechanisms.

vHive has added support for the state-of-the-art extension [eStargz](https://github.com/containerd/stargz-snapshotter) to container layers and lazy pull support for container images.

vHive supports running Knative on top of [`OpenYurt`](https://openyurt.io/), an open platform that extends upstream Kubernetes to run on edge node pools. More details on how to the `Knative-atop-OpenYurt` mode are described [here](scripts/openyurt-deployer/README.md).

## vHive architecture

![vHive Architecture](docs/figures/vhive_architecture.jpg)

The details of the vHive architecture can be found in our ASPLOS'21 paper
([extended abstract](https://asplos-conference.org/abstracts/asplos21-paper212-extended_abstract.pdf),
[full paper](docs/papers/REAP_ASPLOS21.pdf)).

Currently, vHive supports 3 types of sandboxes for functions, namely
[Firecracker MicroVMs](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/) (default),
[gVisor MicroVMs](https://gvisor.dev/),
and Containerd containers (as in vanilla Knative).

## Getting started with vHive

vHive can be readily deployed on premises or in cloud, with support for nested virtualization.
We provide [a quick-start guide](docs/quickstart_guide.md)
that describes how to set up an experiment with vHive.


## Developing vHive

### Developer's guide and performance analysis with vHive

We provide a basic developer's guide that we plan to extend in future.
We encourage the community to contribute their analysis scenarios and tools.

You can view the vHive documentation [here](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/vhive-serverless/vhive).

### vHive maintenance

vHive is a community-led project maintained by the EASE lab at the University of
Edinburgh and the HySCALE lab at Nanyang Technological University.
To guarantee high code quality and reliability, we deploy fully automated CI
on cloud and self-hosted runners with GitHub Actions.

The statistics of this repository's views, clones, and forks are available by the following
[link](https://vhive-serverless.github.io/vhive.github.io/vhive-serverless/vhive/latest-report/report.html).


### Getting help and contributing

We would be happy to answer any questions in GitHub Issues and encourage the open-source community
to submit new Issues, assist in addressing existing issues and limitations, and contribute their code with Pull Requests.
Please check our guide on [Contributing to vHive](docs/contributing_to_vhive.md) if you would like contribute.
You can also talk to us in our [Slack space](https://join.slack.com/t/vhivetutorials/shared_invite/zt-1fk4v71gn-nV5oev5sc9F4fePg3_OZMQ).
